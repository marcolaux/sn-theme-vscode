## Unmaintained !

This Theme is unmaintained at this moment.

As the Super Editor and Standard Notes itself has made so much progress within the last year I can't keep up with the pace at this stage.

This theme was mostly optimized for the Markdown Editor. I also for some time exclusivly use the Super Editor and the built in themes.

I hope that some people enjoyed this theme for that what it is and was.
